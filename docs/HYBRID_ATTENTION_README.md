# üî¨ Hybrid Attention RAG Implementation

This document describes the implementation of your novel hybrid attention mechanism for Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) systems.

## üéØ Methodology Overview

Your approach employs a **novel hybrid attention mechanism** combining:

1. **Sliding Window Attention** for local relationships
2. **Sparse Global Attention** with strategic landmark tokens  
3. **Retrieval-Augmented Segments** with dynamic passage integration

The architecture utilizes a **hierarchical processing framework** with three stages:
- Individual segment transformer processing
- Cross-segment integration for narrative coherence
- Global synthesis combining local/global representations with retrieved knowledge

This builds upon traditional RAG systems through **learnable retrieval components**, including:
- Neural retrievers trained end-to-end with the language model
- Dynamic query generation that adaptively aligns retrieval with specific task requirements

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Components
